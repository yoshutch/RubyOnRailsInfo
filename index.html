                        Ruby on Rails is an open-source web application framework 
                        that focuses on convention rather than configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ruby on Rails uses the Ruby programming language in 
                        connection with an SQLite3 database. Rails makes assumptions
                        about what the developer needs to get his/her web 
                        application up and running. Therefore the development of the
                        application requires less configuration and gives the 
                        developer more time to code the application rather than 
                        worry about the framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two main philosophies that Ruby on Rails attempts
                        to emphasize:                
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            DRY - "Don't Repeat Yourself." Repetitive code is bad
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Convention Over Configuration - Rails makes assumptions 
                            about what you want rather than requiring lots of 
                            configuration.
                        </li>

                    <h2>General Layout of Rails</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through the command line you can easily create a Rails project. The Rails engine automatically creates the folders and files needed. The general layout or structure of a Rails project helps us understand how Rails works and how similar it is to other MVC frameworks.

                        The main folder is "/app" which contains most of the Ruby code as well as the views and templates. Within in the "/app" folder are the three categories of the Model View Controller (MVC) methodology. The "/app/helpers" folder contains files that assist the model and controller classes. The "/app/views/layouts" folder includes templates that are frequently used in the views.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the fact that Rails focuses on convention rather than configuration it still needs some configuration files, thus the "/config" folder. The "/config" folder also includes the routes file which specifies to Rails which controller is to serve which request to which view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some other notable folders and files include: "/public" and "/db". The "/public" folder includes static files viewable to the world, like stylesheets and javascript files. The "/db" folder contains your current database schema where you can manage the database and SQL scripts.
