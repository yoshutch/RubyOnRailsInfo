                            I am from Sacramento, CA. I am the sixth of seven children. I'm currently studying Information Systems at BYU.

                            I was on the BYU backup Folk Dance Team for two years. I like dancing, computers, movies, and fiction books. I hope to one day be a fiction author. I also served an LDS mission in Madrid Spain from 2008 - 2010.

                            I began my love for computers and programming when I found a free program called "GameMaker." I built hundreds of fun little computer games and in so doing learned the basics behind programming without even knowing it.

                            I began studying Computer Science at BYU learning Java. I worked for the CA Department of Justice as a student programmer for one summer. I am currently a Student Programmer for BYU OIT working on the newly updated <a href="https://home.byu.edu/och/">Off-Campus Housing website</a>.
